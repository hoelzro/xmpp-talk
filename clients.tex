In order to connect to an XMPP server, you're going to need a client.  There's plenty out there;
but here's a list of my personal favorites:

\pause
\subsection*{Cross-Platform}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pidgin
\end{itemize}

\pause
\subsection*{Mac OS X}

\begin{itemize}
\item Adium
\item iChat
\end{itemize}

\pause
\subsection*{Linux}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gajim
\end{itemize}

\pause
\subsection*{Android}

\begin{itemize}
\item Beem
\end{itemize}

Chances are that if you're running Linux, one of the BSDs, or Mac OS X, you have one of these on your computer already;
if you don't and you still want to follow along, you should grab one.
