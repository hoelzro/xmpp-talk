In order to connect to an XMPP server, you're going to need a client.  A list of clients
can be found here: \url{http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients}

Here's a list of clients that I'm fond of:

\subsection*{Windows}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pidgin
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mac OS X}

\begin{itemize}
\item Adium
\item Pidgin
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Linux}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gajim
\item Pidgin
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Android}

\begin{itemize}
\item Beem
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{iPhone}

\begin{itemize}
\item (I don't know of any!)
\end{itemize}

Chances are you have one of these on your computer already; if you don't and you still
want to follow along, you can use a web client I wrote here: \url{http://chat.madmongers/}.
\footnote{I'll show you how I wrote this later!}
