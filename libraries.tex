\section{Libraries}

\pause
The final piece of the XMPP software puzzle is libraries.  Since this is a MadMongers meeting, I'll be covering AnyEvent::XMPP.
If you're following along, please install it:

\pause

\begin{shaded}
\$ cpanm AnyEvent::XMPP
\end{shaded}

\pause

Obviously, we need libraries to do anything useful, unless you spend your life creating "Hello, World!" programs.
