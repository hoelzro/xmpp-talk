The final piece of the XMPP software puzzle is libraries.  As programmers, we need
libraries to do anything useful, unless you spend your life creating implementations of
"Hello, World" in every computer language known to man.

\pause
There are many open-source implementations of XMPP out there; for a comprehensive list,
please consult

\url{http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/libraries}.

\newpage
Since this is a MadMongers meeting, I'll be covering AnyEvent::XMPP.  Also, since a lot
of you would probably like to use XMPP in a web application context, I'll also briefly cover
Strophe, which is an XMPP implementation for Javascript and what I used to write the web
client.

\pause

If you're following along, please install AnyEvent::XMPP:

\begin{shaded}
\$ cpanm AnyEvent::XMPP
\end{shaded}
