The source code for my XMPP talk.

Code for the examples is under examples/.

To build the PDF, just run 'make', and xmpp-talk.pdf will be built.

This presentation requires the following LaTeX packages to be installed:

- texpower
- minted
- ifplatform
- pdftexcmds
- infwarerr
- ifluatex
- ltxcmds
- catchfile
- etexcmds
- framed
- verbatim

Most of these can be easily installed out of the oberdiek distribution.

Minted itself requires the pygments Python module to be installed.
